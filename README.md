==================
Ahha, I setup my first personal website. Internet means things keep expiring. I search for quite a few stuff on how to host 
personal website with github. Even the official webpage contains out-dated instructions. Yeah, I know it is simple if you 
know how to do it. The reality is that it turns to be hard when you do it yourself.

Mostly, I follow this blog - http://readwrite.com/2013/11/27/github-pages-explained Thanks the author.
